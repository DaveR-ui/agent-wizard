# Protocol: Subagent Spec Template

Canonical shape for subagent definitions under `.opencode/agents/subagents/`. Read this before creating a new subagent, auditing an existing one, or scaffolding subagents from the installer (Phase 4 of `agent-installer.md`).

> Design decisions ratified by the human on 2026-07-29 (orchestrator instance `subagent-spec-template-001`, CHECKPOINT 1).
> Centralization (frontmatter as the single source of truth for per-agent config; sibling `<id>.schema.json` files; `opencode.json` reduced to top-level runtime config) ratified on 2026-07-29 (orchestrator instance `centralize-002`).
> 3-section shell with anchor variant (Option A) ratified 2026-08-24 (Phase 1 of subagent standardization) — see §3.1.

## Purpose

One canonical shape for every subagent spec, so that:

1. The orchestrator, the installer, and human reviewers can rely on a predictable structure.
2. The agent system can be **specialized per language / stack in the future without duplicating structural content**: structural content lives in the **parent subagent**, variable content lives in a **per-specialization template**.

> A language-specialized subagent = parent + template, composed into a single file.

## The structural / variable split

| Parent subagent — STRUCTURAL (invariant across specializations) | Template — VARIABLE (per specialization) |
|---|---|
| Frontmatter | `## Stack / Context` |
| `## Role` | `## Standards` |
| `## Scope` | `## Anti-Patterns` |
| `## Structured Return` | Role-specific **knowledge** sections (e.g. a future `## Reference Catalog`) |
| `## Rules` | |
| Role-specific **operational** sections | |

### Operational vs. knowledge role-specific sections

- **Operational (stay in the parent)** — describe HOW the role operates; they do not change with the language or stack:
  - `## Sampling and Fan-out` (`explorer`, `reviewer`)
  - `## Read/Write Workflow` (`project-context`)
  - `## Contract`, `## Model`, `## When to use` / `## When NOT to use` (`external-scout`)
  - `## Approach` (`explorer` — grep/glob usage, fan-out guidance) — an operational slot inside Section 2, NOT an alias for `## Rules`
- **Knowledge (live in the template)** — describe WHAT the role must know about a stack; they change per specialization:
  - Stack facts, versions, doc pointers, coding standards, anti-patterns, reference catalogs.

Rationale: a future `explorer.typescript` fans out exactly like the base `explorer`; putting fan-out rules in each language template would invite drift between specializations.

## Frontmatter spec

| Field | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | **required** | One line, routing-oriented — the orchestrator reads this to decide delegation. Name the discipline, the accepted task shapes, and the structured return if any. |
| `mode` | **required** | Literal value (`primary` for delivery, `subagent` for everything else). |
| `model` | optional | Fully qualified (`<provider>/<model>`). Declared in the agent's frontmatter as an explicit override; when omitted, the subagent inherits the invoking primary agent's model (per opencode docs). Part of the cost contract — see the orchestrator's subagent table. |
| `temperature` | optional | Declared in the agent's frontmatter. Omit when the model ignores it (e.g. `kimi-k3`, kimi family). |
| `tools` | optional | Tool allow/deny map. |
| `permission` | optional | Permission rules (e.g. read-only adapters, `task` fan-out grants). |
| `output_schema` | optional | Relative path to the sibling JSON Schema (`./<id>.schema.json`) — see the bridge below. |

## Canonical full shape

Body sections, in canonical order, grouped into 3 macro sections with grep-stable HTML comment anchors. Each macro heading MUST carry its anchor on the same line; the comment is part of the heading and must not be removed. Ordering lint matches anchors, not bare heading text.

### 3.1 The 3-section shell

The 7+1 canonical headings are grouped into 3 macro sections. The mapping is lossless — no heading is removed, only grouped:

| Macro | Anchor (on `##` line) | Contains (`###` sub-headings) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Init / Preconditions | `<!-- Section 1: Init -->` | `### Role`, `### Scope`, `### Stack / Context` | identity + acceptance + knowledge |
| 2 — Execution / Standards | `<!-- Section 2: Execution -->` | `### Standards`, `### Anti-Patterns`, (slot) role-specific operational sections | how to work + what to avoid |
| 3 — Finalization / Return | `<!-- Section 3: Finalization -->` | `### Structured Return`, `### Rules` | output contract + hard rules |

SSOT re-assertion (inside the shell, unchanged): frontmatter remains the single source of truth for per-agent config (`description`, `mode`, `model`, `temperature`, `permission`, `output_schema` → sibling `./<id>.schema.json`); `opencode.json` carries top-level runtime only (`$schema`, `default_agent`, `permission` global, `instructions`, `references`, `compaction`) — no `agent` block. The shell does not move frontmatter fields. The installer (Phase 4) generates frontmatter + sibling schema from the same answer set and MUST emit the three macro anchors when scaffolding.

Original canonical order preserved (for reference):

1. `## Role` — who the agent is (1–3 sentences). The H1 title plus a short preamble may sit above it.
2. `## Scope` — the accept / decline contract: which task shapes it takes, which it re-routes (and to whom).
3. `## Stack / Context` — knowledge: stack facts, versions, project-doc pointers.
4. `## Standards` — checklists, principles, definitions of done.
5. `## Anti-Patterns` — what to avoid, phrased as prohibitions with brief reasons.
6. *(slot)* Role-specific sections, if any: operational ones in every specialization, knowledge ones only inside a template.
7. `## Structured Return` — the output contract (see the bridge below).
8. `## Rules` — hard behavioral rules, terse, one per line.

Existing sections keep working names where renaming adds no value (e.g. reviewer's `## Checklist` serves as `## Standards`; the audit harmonizes, it does not churn — see Alias tolerance below).

### Anchor contract

- Pattern: `<!-- Section N: <Name> -->` where `N ∈ {1,2,3}` and `<Name>` is `Init`, `Execution`, or `Finalization`.
- Placement: on the same line as the `## N — <Title>` heading, trailing after a space. Example: `## 1 — Init / Preconditions  <!-- Section 1: Init -->`.
- Ordering: anchors if present must be strictly increasing `1 < 2 < 3`, no duplicates. A file with fewer than 3 macros (thin variants) passes if present anchors are ordered.
- Grep stability: `grep -n '<!-- Section [123]:' <file>` is the source of truth for macro order. Do not rely on bare `##` text.
- Renderer tolerance: validators MUST strip trailing `<!-- ... -->` before matching the markdown heading, so a formatter that moves the comment to the next line still matches leniently, but the canonical form is same-line.
- Scope: anchors are required for NEW and edited subagent specs going forward. Existing 14 subagents are not mass-retrofitted; audits harmonize, they do not churn.

### Alias tolerance (30-day migration)

During one cycle (30 days from this spec's `last_updated`), tolerant aliases are accepted via an HTML comment on the `###` line. The comment is grep-stable and exclusive-or with the canonical heading — a file MUST NOT contain both the canonical and an alias for the same concept (lint fails). After 30 days the alias is a hard error and the file must be rewritten to the canonical heading.

| Canonical (normative) | Tolerated aliases | Required annotation on `###` line | Example | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `### Standards` | `Principles`, `Checklist` | `<!-- alias: Standards -->` | `### Checklist <!-- alias: Standards -->` (reviewer) or `### Principles <!-- alias: Standards -->` (architect) | 30 days then rewrite to `### Standards` |
| `### Structured Return` | `Output`, `Structured Output` | `<!-- alias: Structured Return -->` | `### Output <!-- alias: Structured Return -->` | 30 days then rewrite |
| `### Rules` | `Guidelines` | `<!-- alias: Rules -->` | `### Guidelines <!-- alias: Rules -->` | 30 days then rewrite |

Notes:
- `### Approach` is NOT an alias for `### Rules`. `explorer.md` has both `## Approach` (operational, grep/glob + fan-out) and `## Rules` (hard rules) — `Approach` belongs to the operational slot inside Section 2.
- `### Contract` is NOT an alias for `### Structured Return`. In thin Variant B, `### Contract` means Role+Scope merged (the prose return is described inside `### Structured Return` or the contract itself for text-return adapters). Document its dual role explicitly; do not alias it to Structured Return.
- `Minimal shape` remains a legacy term for thin adapters — six external cross-refs (`agent-installer.md`, `ia-dev.md`, `protocols/README.md`, etc.) still use it; treat it as an alias for "thin variants" during migration.

### Ordering lint examples

Macro order (anchors):

```bash
# Fail if anchors out of order or duplicated
grep -n '<!-- Section [123]:' .opencode/agents/subagents/<id>.md \
  | grep -o 'Section [123]' | awk '{print $2}' | tr '\n' ' ' | grep -qE '^1 2 3 $|^1 3 $|^1 $|^2 3 $|^3 $' \
  || echo "anchor order violation"

# Python validator (strict on anchor order, tolerant on heading text)
import re, sys
txt = open(sys.argv[1]).read()
anchors = [int(m.group(1)) for m in re.finditer(r'<!-- Section (\d):', txt)]
assert anchors == sorted(anchors) and len(anchors) == len(set(anchors)), f"out-of-order or duplicate {anchors}"
```

Intra-macro H3 order (anchors alone are insufficient):

```bash
# Inside each macro, H3 order must be canonical (e.g., Sec1: Role→Scope→Stack/Context)
grep -n '^### ' .opencode/agents/subagents/<id>.md
# Expected Sec1: Role, Scope, Stack / Context
# Expected Sec2: Standards (or alias), Anti-Patterns, slot
# Expected Sec3: Structured Return (or alias), Rules (or alias)
```

```python
# Dual lint: macro + H3
import re, sys
txt = open(sys.argv[1]).read()
# 1. macro anchor order
anchors = [int(m.group(1)) for m in re.finditer(r'<!-- Section (\d):', txt)]
assert anchors == sorted(anchors)
# 2. H3 order inside each macro (simplified)
h3s = re.findall(r'^### (.+?)(?:\s+<!-- alias:.*?-->)?\s*$', txt, re.M)
# Canonical H3 sequence (allow omission for thin variants, but if present order must hold)
canonical = ["Role","Scope","Stack / Context","Standards","Anti-Patterns","Structured Return","Rules"]
# Check alias-normalized names are in canonical order
```

Alias lint (warnings → errors after 30 days):

```bash
grep -n '^### .*<!-- alias:' .opencode/agents/subagents/<id>.md  # emits warnings
# CI promotes to error after 30d via: git log --diff-filter=A --format=%ad --date=short -- <file> vs. deadline
# Exclusive-or check: fail if file contains both canonical and alias for same concept
grep -q '^### Standards' file && grep -q '<!-- alias: Standards -->' file && echo "exclusive-or violation: both Standards and alias"
```

## Macro section details

The following three macro sections instantiate the shell above. New subagents MUST use this shell; existing subagents are retrofitted only when edited.

## 1 — Init / Preconditions  <!-- Section 1: Init -->

### Role

Who the agent is (1–3 sentences). The H1 title plus a short preamble may sit above it.

### Scope

The accept / decline contract: which task shapes it takes, which it re-routes (and to whom).

### Stack / Context

Knowledge: stack facts, versions, project-doc pointers.

## 2 — Execution / Standards  <!-- Section 2: Execution -->

### Standards

Checklists, principles, definitions of done.

### Anti-Patterns

What to avoid, phrased as prohibitions with brief reasons.

### (slot) Role-specific operational sections

If any: operational ones in every specialization, knowledge ones only inside a template. Examples: `## Sampling and Fan-out`, `## Read/Write Workflow`, `## Contract` (Variant B), `## Approach` (explorer).

## 3 — Finalization / Return  <!-- Section 3: Finalization -->

### Structured Return

The output contract (see the bridge below).

### Rules

Hard behavioral rules, terse, one per line.

## Thin variants inside the 3-section shell

A subagent that is a **thin adapter over a single capability** — no `output_schema` or contract fits in ~50 lines — MAY use a reduced form INSIDE the same 3-section shell. The shell is not bypassed; macros are omitted by design and documented below. Do not force the full 7-section form onto thin adapters (would bloat 43–61L thin adapters to 79–128L full, ~60% overhead, and contradict the 2026-08-02 decision to delegate stack knowledge to `docs/context/`).

Two sanctioned variants:

| Variant | Shell sections used | Sub-headings present | Example files | Lines | When to use | Must contain |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Variant A: Stack/Context-delegating coder/tester | 1 (partial) + 3 | Sec1: only `### Stack / Context`; Sec2: omitted or only slot; Sec3: `### Rules` + `### Structured Return` | `coder.md`, `tester.md` (43–80L) | 43–80 | Coder/test specialist with `docs/context/` delegation (knowledge lives in `docs/context/`, not in spec) | `Stack / Context` pointing to `docs/context/` as truth, `Rules`, `Structured Return` (CoderOutput/TesterOutput via sibling schema), frontmatter with `output_schema` |
| Variant B: Contract minimal relay | 1 (merged) + 2/3 (partial) | `### Contract` (Role+Scope merged) + `### When to use` / `### When NOT to use` (+ `### Model` if needed) inside Sec1 or Sec2; Sec3 may be omitted if text return | `external-scout.md` (61L) | 61 | Single-capability relay/scout: one package+version lookup, no `output_schema`, text return, deny `edit`/`bash` | `Contract` (one capability), `When to use`, `When NOT to use`, `Model`; permission deny as needed |

Rules for thin variants:
- Variant A is explicitly exempt from `### Role` and `### Scope` in Sec1 — it delegates identity/scope to the `docs/context/` slice table. Do not add empty `Role`/`Scope` to satisfy the shell.
- Variant B's `### Contract` is the merged Role+Scope; it is NOT an alias for `### Structured Return` — the return is prose/text described in the contract.
- Both variants remain valid inside the 3-section shell via omitted macros + alias annotations where needed; the full shape (3 macros, all H3s) remains the default for all other subagents (`architect`, `explorer`, `reviewer`, `documenter`, `analista`, `interpreter`, `project-context`) — `tester` is now Variant A (framework-parameterized thin adapter, 2026-08-25) alongside `coder`.
- Legacy term `Minimal shape (thin adapters)` is retained as an alias for this section — six external cross-refs still use it (`agent-installer.md` lines 19/66, `ia-dev.md`, `protocols/README.md` line 29). Update those cross-refs in a follow-up pass.

## The `output_schema` ↔ sibling schema bridge

- The schema lives in a **sibling file** `.opencode/agents/subagents/<id>.schema.json`, referenced from the subagent's frontmatter via `output_schema: ./<id>.schema.json`. The `.md` frontmatter is the single source of truth for the return contract.
- The subagent's `## Structured Return` section documents the JSON shape, names the schema, shows an example, and points at the sibling file.
- The two MUST stay in sync: change one, change the other. The installer (Phase 4) generates both from the same answer set.
- Subagents without an `output_schema` return plain text (or markdown); their `## Structured Return` (full shape) or `## Contract` (minimal/thin Variant B) describes the expected return in prose. Current subagents without a schema: `project-context`, `external-scout`.
- The task tool validates the return against the schema; on mismatch it prepends a validation warning and keeps the raw text. Never write `summary.md` / `output-full.md` / `manifest.md` to disk — the runtime captures returns on the EventV2 bus.

## `opencode.json` — top-level runtime knobs only

Since the 2026-07-29 centralization and the simplification ratified 2026-08-02, `opencode.json` carries **top-level runtime config only**: `$schema`, `default_agent`, `permission` (global), `instructions`, `references`, `compaction`. There is **no `agent` block** — every per-agent field (including `model` and `temperature`) lives in the agent's `.md` frontmatter.

Every per-agent field lives in the agent's `.md` frontmatter:

| Field | Home |
|---|---|
| `description`, `mode`, `model`, `temperature`, `permission` | The agent `.md` frontmatter |
| `output_schema` | Frontmatter path → sibling `<id>.schema.json` |
| `permission.task` fan-out (which subagents `delivery` / `orchestrator` may call) | Frontmatter of `delivery.md` / `orchestrator.md` |
| Global `permission` rules | Stay in `opencode.json` |

**To change a model or temperature**: edit the agent's frontmatter (`.opencode/agents/subagents/<id>.md`), then restart opencode. `opencode.json` is untouched.

Rationale: the `.md` is the canonical artifact the runtime loads; keeping `model`/`temperature` in the agent file makes each agent self-contained — one file to read for everything about that agent, with no frontmatter↔JSON drift. `opencode.json` shrinks to true runtime config.

## Naming convention for specializations

- Parent keeps the plain role name (e.g. `coder.md`).
- Template / specialization: `<role>.<specialization>.md` — e.g. `coder-angular.md`, `coder-go.md` (historical). As of 2026-08-24 the coders are centralized into a single language-parameterized `coder.md` (Variant A) that branches by a `language=angular|go` task payload instead of per-language files.

## Realized example: `coder.md` — language-parameterized thin adapter (2026-08-24)

The coders were centralized into a single thin adapter on 2026-08-24, replacing `coder-angular.md` + `coder-go.md`. `coder.md` is small, self-contained, and delegates stack knowledge to `docs/context/`, branching on the `language` parameter in the task payload:

```
coder.md
────────────────────────────────────────────
frontmatter: mode, model, permission,
  output_schema
## 1 — Init / Preconditions  (Section 1)
   ### Stack / Context → branch by language:
     language=angular → Angular docs in
       docs/context/ (source of truth)
     language=go     → Go docs in docs/context/
       (source of truth), gofmt/go vet
     fallback        → docs/project.md Slices
       table
## 2 — Execution / Standards  (Section 2)
   minimal slot — standards delegated to the
   language docs (no duplication)
## 3 — Finalization / Return  (Section 3)
   ### Structured Return → CoderOutput
   ### Rules → follow docs, canonical commands,
     English
```

It shares the sibling schema `coder.schema.json` (`CoderOutput`). Model + temperature live in the coder's frontmatter (`model: opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash`). Under the 3-section shell this maps to Sec1 `Stack / Context` + Sec2 minimal slot + Sec3 `Rules` + `Structured Return` (Variant A).

## Composition rules (documented future)

1. A specialized subagent file = the parent's structural sections **verbatim** + the template's variable sections, ordered per the canonical full shape above.
2. Structural sections are **inherited, not copied-and-edited**: if a structural section must change, change the parent and re-compose every specialization.
3. Template resolution: `<role>.<specialization>.md` composes with `<role>.md`. **No runtime implementation exists yet** — this protocol fixes only the boundary. When the first template is introduced, decide storage (suggestion: `.opencode/agents/templates/`, not auto-loaded) and the composition mechanism (installer Phase 4 is the natural place).
4. Frontmatter composition: the child template's frontmatter **wins over the parent's for any field it declares**; undeclared fields are inherited from the parent. (`mode: subagent` and the `output_schema` bridge are normally inherited, not overridden.)

## Dual-file convention (retired 2026-08-02)

The old top-level twins at `.opencode/agents/<id>.md` (previously `coder`, `architect`, `interpreter`, `vision-relay`) were **deleted**. Every agent now has exactly **one** definition file under `.opencode/agents/subagents/` — the runtime loads it directly (opencode scans `agent(s)/**/*.md`). Do not recreate a twin: a second file with the same agent name creates a duplicate agent.

## Audit results — 2026-07-29

Status of the 10 subagents under `.opencode/agents/subagents/` after the canonical-shape audit (Phase B of the same change that introduced this protocol):

| Subagent | Shape | Gaps found (before) | Status (after) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `architect` | full | Missing Role, Scope, Anti-Patterns; Principles served as Standards; context inline | Canonical |
| `coder` | full | Missing Role; stale "Go implementation" reference in description (Q3 fix) | Canonical |
| `documenter` | full | Missing Role, Stack / Context, Standards | Canonical |
| `explorer` | full | Missing Role, Scope, Anti-Patterns; stale opencode-monorepo references (Q3 fix) | Canonical |
| `external-scout` | minimal | — (thin adapter) | Minimal |
| `interpreter` | full | Missing Role, Scope (partial in "When you are called"), Stack / Context, Standards, Anti-Patterns | Canonical |
| `project-context` | full | Missing Role, Scope, Standards, Anti-Patterns; text return undocumented | Canonical |
| `reviewer` | full | Missing Role, Scope, Anti-Patterns; Stack / Context partial | Canonical |
| `tester` | full | Missing Role, Scope, Anti-Patterns; Stack / Context partial | Canonical |
| `vision-relay` | minimal | — (thin adapter) | Minimal |

## Audit results — 2026-07-29 (centralization)

Frontmatter is the source of truth for per-agent config; `output_schema` lives in frontmatter as a path pointing at a sibling `<id>.schema.json` file; `opencode.json` carries no per-agent config (simplification ratified 2026-08-02); the `permission.task` fan-out for `delivery` / `orchestrator` lives in their frontmatter.

| Subagent | `permission` in frontmatter | `output_schema` in frontmatter | Sibling schema file |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coder-angular` | ✅ | `./coder.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `coder-go` | ✅ | `./coder.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `tester` | ✅ | `./tester.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `reviewer` | ✅ | `./reviewer.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `architect` | ✅ | `./architect.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `explorer` | ✅ | `./explorer.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `analista` | ✅ | `./analista.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `documenter` | ✅ | `./documenter.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `interpreter` | ✅ | `./interpreter.schema.json` | ✅ |
| `project-context` | ✅ | — (text return) | — |
| `vision-relay` | ✅ (tool allow/deny map) | — (text return) | — |
| `external-scout` | ✅ (tool allow/deny map) | — (text return) | — |

## Audit results — 2026-08-24 (coder centralization + image inspection)

`vision-relay`, `coder-angular.md`, and `coder-go.md` were **deleted**; implementation is centralized into a single language-parameterized `coder.md`, and image inspection is absorbed by `interpreter.md`.

| Subagent | Change |
|---|---|
| `coder` | New thin adapter (Variant A) replacing `coder-angular.md` / `coder-go.md`; branches by `language=angular\|go` task payload; reuses `./coder.schema.json` (`CoderOutput`) |
| `coder-angular` | **deleted** |
| `coder-go` | **deleted** |
| `vision-relay` | **deleted**; image inspection absorbed by `interpreter` (adds `read: allow`, image path + one focused question → compact textual answer) |
| `interpreter` | Absorbed vision-relay; still `./interpreter.schema.json` (`InterpreterOutput`) |

## Audit results — 2026-08-25 (tester framework-parameterization)

`tester` moved from full shape (80L) to thin Variant A framework-parameterized adapter (66L), branching by `framework=vitest|karma-jasmine|playwright|go` plus conditional `linter=eslint|biome`, reusing `failures[]` for lint and explicit not-run `tests_run=0, failures=["no framework informed — test ignored"]`.

| Subagent | Change |
|---|---|
| `tester` | Thin adapter (Variant A) replacing full shape; branches by `framework=vitest\|karma-jasmine\|playwright\|go` via task payload plus conditional `linter=eslint\|biome`; reuses `./tester.schema.json` (`TesterOutput`) unchanged; coverage tri-state documented |

## Rules

- New subagents MUST follow this spec (full or minimal/thin shape) from day one — the installer references this file as the Phase 4 shape authority (and MUST emit macro anchors when scaffolding).
- Audits fill missing sections with sensible content; they do NOT rewrite sections that already work.
- Structural edits to a parent that has (future) specializations require re-composing all of them.
- All `.opencode/` files in ENGLISH.
